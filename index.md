## About Me
<div align="justify">
I am a research scientist at TU Dortmund University, working on AI applications in healthcare with a focus on large language models and physiological and behavioral wearable signals, such as actigraphy and accelerometer data, for the prediction of chronic diseases. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and, more recently, large language models. Prior to my current position, I gained around four years of professional experience as a Data Scientist and R&D Machine Learning Engineer, contributing to various AI applications in computer vision, speech, time series analysis, and beyond. I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a specialization in AI and Robotics from the University of Tehran, and my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applications with a minor in Computer Science from Shiraz University.
